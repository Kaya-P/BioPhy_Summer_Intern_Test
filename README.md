Hey all, 

The dataset in the repository is a simple human/bot classification dataset. 

Instructions: 

1. Please fork this repository to your personal git. 
2. Please have the whole code with the neccesery comments and 'markdown' paragraphs in a single jupyter notebook - Additional reports (MS Word Docs) are not necessery. Please upload that jupyter where all the results and comments are clearly visible to the forked github either as pdf or as .ipynb file. 
3. Please provide brief reasons to why you chose to do each step. For example, if you choose to scale the data using standardScaler, why did you feel like scaling? Why standardScalar module and not others in just a line or 2.  
4. Print out all the performance metrics appropriate in the end. 
5. In the end of the project, in about 5-6 lines briefly explain what you comprehended by looking at the performance metrics of the classifier. 
6. In one or two points, explain what more can be done in the future to improvise the results. 
7. Your test will be evaluated equally based on your presentation, different steps you chose to approach this problem and their reasons. The final performance is not that much of a concern, but reasons to why you feel this was the best approach is considered more important. 


Best of luck!
